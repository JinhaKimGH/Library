# Library App

This project simulates a personal library.

Books and their basic information are displayed on a page on their own card.

## Features

New books can be added to the display, which can be specified with: author, title, number of pages, and whether it's been read.

Books can be removed from the library with a button on the book's card.

A book's `read` status can also be changed with a button on the book's card.
